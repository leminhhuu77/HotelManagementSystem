# How to use
### In order to download and run the project ( It is assumed that Python 3 is already installed ):
1. Install Django and Apps:
```shell
pip install Django==3.1.4
pip install django-phonenumber-field[phonenumbers]
```
2. Clone project from github:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/leminhhuu77/HotelManagementSystem.git
```
## Needed to create roles and admin account
### If you want to use my database, i should sign up with username = 'admin' and password ='admin123' instead of step 3 below
### Else You wil delete my database (file db.sqlite3) and Change Directory to HotelManagementSystem/HMS and run the shell
```shell
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```
## then excute step 3 below:
3. Change Directory to HotelManagementSystem/HMS and start the Shell:
```shell
python manage.py shell
```
* Then execute these, one by one:
```shell
from django.contrib.auth.models import Group, User
```

```shell
from accounts.models import Employee
```

```shell
Group.objects.create(name='admin')
```

```shell
Group.objects.create(name='guest')
```

```shell
user = User.createuser=User.objects.create_user('admin', password='admin123')
```

```shell
group = Group.objects.get(name="admin")
```

```shell
user.groups.add(group)
```
```shell
admin = Employee(user=user)
```
```shell
admin.save()
```

### Finally:
* Exit the shell and set the database: 
```shell
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```
Then, start the server
```shell
python manage.py runserver
```
* This will work if correctly set up.
## Working
1. Manager login with username = 'admin' and password = 'admin123'
2. After login, the manager add some room because the database is empty.
3. A new guest sign up and creates a new account. Then he/she logins using usernam and password.
4. After logging in, guest books a room. If they want to change room or delete the reservation, they should contact to admin.
5. Guests can change their information
